# DHIS2 Package for Hypertension and Diabetes (NCDs)

## About
A DHIS2 package that can be used by any team working on hypertension and/or diabetes control projects. The package consists of a **DHIS2 Tracker program** to manage individual patients and a **DHIS2 Dashboard** to monitor program outcomes.

This package draws on the many lessons the team has learned while developing the [Simple.org](https://simple.org/) project and is based on the [WHO HEARTS indicators](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260423/WHO-NMH-NVI-18.5-eng.pdf). This package is being used in Nigeria to manage over 30,000 patients with hypertension.
